# Lab 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization

This repository performs EDA a student dataset. The purpose of this lab was to demonstrate the use of Python and pandas for loading, inspecting, cleaning, and visualizing real-world data. 

## Repository Purpose

The purpose was to:
- Load datasets with pandas
- Computing typical stats such as mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.
- Visualizing distributions and relationships using packages
- Cleaning and standardizing data for analysis.


## Dataset Description

The dataset provided (students.csv) contains data on high school students including their age, GPA, declared major, and other demographic info. Some values may be missing or messy, which allows for practicing basic data cleaning techniques. After wrangling, the cleaned version of the dataset is saved as students_clean.csv.

## Environment Setup

To run this project, youâ€™ll need to set up your environment with the following:
- pandas for data analysis
- seaborn and matplotlib for plotting
- pytest (for stretch goals)
- notebook and ipykernel for working in Jupyter
